# KaggleDatabaseLoader
Several Python scripts to load data from csv's into a MySQL database

Needed CSV files are found in these Datasets from kaggle.com:

Iris Species
Human Resources Analytics
Exoplanet Hunting in Deep Space

... more to come in the following months.

At the top of the file, there is a function called dbstuff, you must enter your information for your database there.
In main, you must enter the file paths to each csv file, I have not changed the names of those files in the functions.
